abstract = {Two previously known bands in the excitation scheme of the 154Tb nucleus have been investigated for the multipolarity and the electric/magnetic nature of the intra- and inter-band transitions. The excited states of the nucleus were populated in an α-beam induced reaction and the γ-rays emitted therefrom were detected using an array of Compton suppressed HPGe clover detectors. The experimental findings are indicative of a shape evolution of the nucleus and development of strong triaxiality at higher spins. The multipolarities of the inter-band transitions brings forth the same. Total Routhian Surface (TRS) calculations and those in the framework of Triaxial Projected Shell Model (TPSM) have been carried out and the results corroborate the proposition on triaxiality.}
